                <p>"When I became an Eagle Scout at the age of 14, I accepted the charge to exemplify the high principles and values expressed in the Scout Oath and Scout Law in my daily life. I believe the principles of Trustworthiness, Loyalty, Helpfulness, Friendliness, Courtesy, Kindness, Obedience, Cheerfulness, Thriftiness, Bravery, Cleanliness, and Reverence are reflective of the exact qualities that make a good Constable. I believe America was built on the sound foundations of clean living, honest work, unselfish citizenship, and reverence for God. I strive to uphold these principles in all aspects of my daily life.<br> I ask for your vote on or before August, 26th."</p>

                <p> <span class="aboutSG">What Is a Constable:</span><br>
                    The Constable is an elected official who serves as the Executive Branch of the Courts. Constables are empowered to serve all process given to them by the Justice of the Peace or other competent authority. The process includes service of criminal and civil subpoenas and summonses, writs of restitution (eviction orders), writs of execution (orders to collect judgments), writs of replevin (orders to seize property), orders of protection and injunctions against harassment as well as any other orders from the courts.<br>
                    Constables who are elected by voters within their judicial precincts are able to provide timely and cost efficient service by working directly with the courts in their local communities to ensure the court's orders are served.<br>

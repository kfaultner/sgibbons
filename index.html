                <p> What is a constable:<br>
                    The Constable is an elected official who serves as the Executive Branch of the Courts. Constables are empowered to serve all process given to them by the Justice of the Peace or other competent authority. The process includes service of criminal and civil subpoenas and summonses, writs of restitution (eviction orders), writs of execution (orders to collect judgments), writs of replevin (orders to seize property), orders of protection and injunctions against harassment as well as any other orders from the courts.<br>
                    Constables who are elected by voters within their judicial precincts are able to provide timely and cost efficient service by working directly with the courts in their local communities to ensure the court's orders are served.<br>

                <p>“Steve is a leader who brings passion, common sense, and a strong work ethic. He would make an excellent Constable. I urge you to join me in supporting Steve Gibbons for University Lakes Constable.”<br>
